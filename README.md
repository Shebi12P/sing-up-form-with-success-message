# Project name

Newsletter signup form with success message

# Project description

It's a solution for the Frontend Mentor - Newsletter signup form with success message (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv). The app checks if the provided email is correct
and if it is, then it shows the success message.

# The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
